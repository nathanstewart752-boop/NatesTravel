      This post documents my journey to Paris in April&nbsp;2025. Even though these
      photos are placeholders, they represent the wonderful memories made while
      exploring the City of Light. I strolled along the Seine, admired art at
      world‑class museums, and savoured croissants at charming cafés. The mix
      of historic architecture and vibrant street life made every moment feel
      magical.
