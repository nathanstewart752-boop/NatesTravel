      The thundering roar of Niagara Falls is something that has to be
      experienced firsthand. This placeholder image can’t capture the sheer
      power of the water cascading over the cliffs, but it will remind you to
      substitute your own photographs from the day. Watching the mist rise and
      feeling the spray on my face was exhilarating.

      Use this space to recount the details of your adventure—whether you took
      a boat ride to the base of the falls, explored nearby wineries, or
      enjoyed a leisurely walk along the promenade. Adding your own text and
      images will make this story personal and meaningful.
